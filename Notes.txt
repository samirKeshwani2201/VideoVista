* The two challenges with the live chat features is :
 -Get Data live :
    For this we can have 2 ways :
        -Web  Sockets(No regular interval) :Is a 2 way connection established ,is like a handshake between server and a UI so that we can quickly send the data from either sides,In a live chat application we require web Sockets as in api polling the order of the data may change and this is not preffered

 -Update the UI
