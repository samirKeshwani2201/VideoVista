* The two challenges with the live chat features is :
 -Get Data live :
    For this we can have 2 ways :
        -Web  Sockets(No regular interval) :Is a 2 way connection established ,is like a handshake between server and a UI so that we can quickly send the data from either sides,In a live chat application we require web Sockets as in api polling the order of the data may change and this is not preffered  
        -Long polling/Api polling() :Its one directional ,data flows from the server to ui

 -Update the UI

 *useMemo: Takes in first parameter as the function that needs to be memoized useMemo returns a value ,second parameter specify when we have to change it that is dependecies 
 *useRef:When we dont want to rerender a data in the component like local variables ,after rerender all its values are again initialized and old values are lost so to avoid this we use useRef
